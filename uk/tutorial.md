# Навчальний посібник

Zephir, і цей посібник, призначені для PHP-розробників, які хочуть створити C-розширення, але не знають C.

Ми припускаємо, що ви маєте досвід в одній або декількох інших мовах програмування. Ми проведемо паралелі з функціями PHP, C, JavaScript та іншими мовами. Ми акцентуватимемо увагу на функції Zephir, які є подібними до функцій в інших мовах, а також на функціях які є новими. Якщо ви знайомі з цими мовами вам буде простіше розібратися що до чого.

У цьому посібнику ми будемо використовувати стандартний термінал команд Linux. If you are a Windows user, you need to replace these commands with their counterparts.

## Каркас розширення

The first thing we have to do is generate an extension skeleton. This will provide to our extension the basic structure we need to start working. In our case, we're going to create an extension called `utils`:

```bash
zephir init utils
```

After this, a directory called "utils" is created on the current working directory:

    utils/
       ext/
       utils/
    

The directory `ext/` (inside utils) contains the code that is going to be used by the compiler to produce the extension. Another directory created is `utils` - this directory has the same name as our extension. We will place Zephir code there.

We need to change the working directory to "utils" to start compiling our code:

```bash
cd utils
ls
ext/ utils/ config.json
```

The directory listing will also show us a file called `config.json`. This file contains configuration settings we can use to alter the behavior of Zephir and/or the extension itself.

<a name='adding-our-first-class'></a>

## Додавання нашого першого класу

Zephir is designed to generate object-oriented extensions. To start developing functionality, we need to add our first class to the extension.

As in many languages/tools, the first thing we want to do is see a `hello world` generated by Zephir, and check that everything is well. So our first class will be called `Utils\Greeting`, and contain a method printing `hello world!`.

The code for this class must be placed in `utils/utils/greeting.zep`:

```zep
namespace Utils;

class Greeting
{

    public static function say()
    {
        echo "Привіт світ!";
    }

}
```

Now, we need to tell Zephir that our project must be compiled and the extension generated:

```bash
zephir build
```

Initially, and only for the first time, a number of internal commands are executed producing the necessary code and configurations to export this class to the PHP extension. If everything goes well, you will see the following message at the end of the output:

    ...
    Extension installed!
    Add extension=utils.so to your php.ini
    Don't forget to restart your web server
    

At the above step, it's likely that you would need to supply your root password in order to install the extension.

Finally, the extension must be added to the `php.ini` in order to be loaded by PHP. This is achieved by adding the initialization directive: `extension=utils.so` to it.

NOTE: You can also load it on the command line with `-d extension=utils.so`, but it will only load for that single request, so you'd need to include it every time you want to test your extension in the CLI. Adding the directive to the `php.ini` will ensure it is loaded for every request from then on.

<a name='initial-testing'></a>

## Первинне тестування

Now that the extension was added to your `php.ini`, check whether the extension is being loaded properly by executing the following:

```bash
php -m
[PHP Modules]
Core
date
libxml
pcre
Reflection
session
SPL
standard
tokenizer
utils
xdebug
xml
```

Extension `utils` should be part of the output, indicating that the extension was loaded correctly. Now, let's see our `hello world` directly executed by PHP. To accomplish this, you can create a simple PHP file calling the static method we have just created:

```php
<?php

echo Utils\Greeting::say(), "\n";
```

Congratulations! Уou have your first extension running in PHP.

## Корисний клас

The `Utils\Greeting::say` method was fine to check if our environment was right. Now, let's create some more useful classes.

The first useful class we are going to add to this extension will provide filtering facilities to users. This class is called `Utils\Filter` and its code must be placed in `utils/utils/filter.zep`:

A basic skeleton for this class is the following:

```zep
namespace Utils;

class Filter
{

}
```

The class contains filtering methods that help users to filter unwanted characters from strings. The first method is called `alpha`, and its purpose is to filter only those characters that are ASCII basic letters. To begin, we are just going to traverse the string, printing every byte to the standard output:

```zep
namespace Utils;

class Filter
{

    public function alpha(string str)
    {
        char ch;

        for ch in str {
            echo ch, "\n";
        }
    }
}
```

When invoking this method:

```php
<?php

$f = new Utils\Filter();
$f->alpha("привіт");
```

You will see:

    п
    р
    и
    в
    і
    т
    

Checking every character in the string is straightforward. Now we'll create another string with the right filtered characters:

```zep
class Filter
{

    public function alpha(string str) -> string
    {
        char ch; string filtered = "";

        for ch in str {
            if (ch >= 'а' && ch <= 'я') || (ch >= 'А' && ch <= 'Я') {
                let filtered .= ch;
            }
        }

        return filtered;
    }
}
```

The complete method can be tested as before:

```php
<?php

$f = new Utils\Filter();
echo $f->alpha("!пр#02и3'121віт."); // надрукує "привіт"
```
